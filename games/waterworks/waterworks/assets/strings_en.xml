        <complete>In 1386, the inhabitants of Grudziądz received permission from the authorities of the Teutonic Order to build a channel that would connect with the natural stream flowing in the nearby town of Węgrowo and bring water to the city. The dug channel was nearly 3 km long and significantly improved the situation of the city's inhabitants. It was the first hydrotechnical investment in Grudziądz of this scale and significance.

        <complete>Taking water directly from the channel and then transporting it to the city was certainly an inefficient and impractical solution, and in the event of a siege or frost all the town's access to drinking water would be cut off. For these reasons, in Grudziądz, there were probably some wells already in place during the Middle Ages, which could be built within the city walls. Another advantage was that the water in those wells did not freeze. Unfortunately, current studies have not confirmed any major information about the wells (the only one still existing is within the castle). Due to the high-ground location of the city, digging traditional wells had to be a difficult, time-consuming and costly task.</complete>

        <desc>Water-work is a device that raises the water to a certain height, enabling gravitational supply to the water pipe network in the city. The water is lifted to a distribution tank located on the top of a tall building, from there it is then distributed by wooden pipes to municipal water wells (so-called sumps). Sumps are most often built on main streets and city squares.</desc>
        <complete>The permission for the construction of the first water-work in Grudziądz was issued by the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Michel Kochmeister in 1415. In the permit, the order approved the constructing of a special building that had a device equipped with a water wheel, which would draw water from the channel by the city and then lift it to an sufficient height in order to distribute it through pipelines around the city. If the water-work in Grudziądz was actually built in the 15th century (which is very likely! - it definitely already existed at the beginning of the 16th century) then it would be the oldest device of this type in the Teutonic state, and after 1466 one of the oldest in the Polish Kingdom.</complete>

        <complete>The Trynka Canal was built in 1552, with permission from King Sigismund II Augustus of Poland. Its name came from the German word "trinken" ("to drink") which emphasized its most important function, which was to provide Grudziądz with drinking water. The total length of the canal was up to 8 km, and its width reached up to 10 m. The Trynka Canal began its course at the Osie River in Kłódka, then headed to Lake Tarpieński, then connected to the mill channel near the city and flowed into the Vistula. A weir system was built along the entire length of the canal, which allowed it to be segmentally dried for carrying out necessary hydrotechnical maintenance works. The construction of Trynka made it possible to supply huge amounts of water to the city, which additionally propelled the wheels of the mills and water-work. At the time, it was the most important and largest hydrotechnical investment carried out in Grudziądz.</complete>

        <complete>Water-work wells, called sumps, usually looked like a barrel without a lid, placed in a wooden crate dug into the ground and had sand strewn in to stabilize it. The sand between the barrel and the crate also played a filtering role, limiting the penetration of external dirt in the well. Water pipes were connected to the barrel.

The earliest possible time must have been at the end of the 15th or at the beginning of the 16th century, when the invention of suction-piston pumps became widespread in Europe, which allowed the transportation of water up to the top of a tall building. This way, the functions of the water-work (low one-story building equipped with pumps) and the water tower (tall building with a distribution tank on top) were clearly separated. The first unambiguous source of evidence indicating the existence of a water tower dates back to 1772.</complete>

Haller's Street, which allowed the construction of a modern municipal water supply. They were launched on December 23, 1899, and at the beginning of the 20th century they were expanded to include a sewage network and sewage treatment plants.

        <complete>In the first half of the 16th century, instead of buckets, water-work in Europe began to use suction and pressure pumps, so-called piston pumps. They were driven by a water wheel through a crankshaft, which exchanged the rotary movement of the wheel for reciprocating movements created by the pistons located in the cylinders. Such a pump could both suck in water from the well and pump it to a certain height. The amount of water pumped depended solely on the design and energy supplied to the pump. This device allowed the transfer of more water to a greater height, and therefore was much more effective than the bucket wheel. The oldest information about the pump in the Grudziądz water-work comes from the mid-seventeenth century, but such a device probably existed there even before that.</complete>

        <desc>Because of lack of water we need to introduce limitations for it and additional fees. Nobody will be allowed to take water for brewing beer without paying a well fee.
This will help us gain some money, but not everyone will like this decision.
A scribe with some documents should be able to take care of this issue.</desc>

You've failed your mission.
Maybe you did your best and just got unlucky - in the end it's the results that matter, your reputation was beyond repair and people just didn't trust your skills anymore.
You have been replaced by someone else to help Grudziądz with its water supply...
</string>

    <gui id="victory">
        <string>SUCCESS!

Nowadays we take water supply for granted. We don't usually ask ourselves what it was like in the past, we don't consider the fact that immediate and easy access to water wasn't available for everyone at all times.
Thanks to your efforts, Grudziądz had enough water supply to thrive.

A modern water supply and sewage system was developed and it's all thanks to you!

You're a true hero to be remembered!
